### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am NIX (nixstory@gmail.com)
- I was once a native developer, but now I am interested in cross-platform development.
- and also interested in react and nextjs, which are modern webs.
- In my experience, the back end is mechanical fun, and the front end seems to be cute fun. Note to developers who are conflicted between frontend and backend.
